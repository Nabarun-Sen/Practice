""" Technically, it isnâ€™t quite correct to say a list must be concatenated
with another list. More precisely, a list must be concatenated with an object
that is iterable. Of course, lists are iterable,so it works to concatenate
a list with another list.

Strings are iterable also.But watch what happens when you concatenate a string
onto a list"""
